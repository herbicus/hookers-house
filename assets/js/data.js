Trust in me: once you’ve sipped upon my wine barrel - aged Kentucky bourbon - with its subtle hint of pinot noir, drinking wine will never feel the same.  Every sip of Hookers House Bourbon should be taken in like an orchestral overture.  Let the warmth and smooth flavor wash over your palette dear drinker, and bask in the glow of the love child of Kentucky and California.."

Trust in me:  once you’ve sipped upon my wine barrel-aged Kentucky bourbon, with its subtle hint of pinot noir, drinking other spirits will never feel the same. From the Bourbon Belt Rick House to the Schug Winery wine barrels, every step in this process is a deliberate attempt to enlighten your senses. Each sip of Hookers House Bourbon should be taken in like an grand orchestral overture.

		loadCopy: "Fightin’ Joe here. You think you’re too good for my bourbon?  You heard about the wine barrel aging and want to walk away thinking I’m a sissy?  I tell you what.  You better walk away because thinking like that will get you tossed out and whipped down around here.",
    loadCopy2: "I’ll tell you what I told the stuffed shirts down at the wine club:  you can keep the damn grapes.  Keep the tasting parties and wine spittoons too.  Who the hell spits out alcohol anyway?  This is bourbon, the drink of hardened criminals and war-torn soldiers.  I added the Schug Winery pinot barrels to give a little natural sweetness to my bourbon.  Why? So I could share it with my lady friends.  It ain’t science.  Well it might be, but I’ll leave that to the university eggs.  What you got here is a good time in a bottle and if you think you’re to macho for that, you’re probably at home drinking straight wine at this very moment. Got a problem?  Come to Hooker’s House and tell me.  But fair warning to men and ladies alike: I bite.",

As a proud resident of Sonoma, California it is my great pleasure to fuse my passion for battle tested bourbon with the smooth sophistication of wine country. But do not underestimate me as I do not come here with designs at fitting in! ",
		loadCopy2: "My bourbon and I are here to disrupt and awaken your dusty wine traditions, my esteemed colleagues. Trust in me: once you’ve sipped upon my wine barrel - aged Kentucky bourbon - with its subtle hint of pinot noir, drinking wine will never feel the same.  Every sip of Hookers House Bourbon should be taken in like an orchestral overture.  Let the warmth and smooth flavor wash over your palette dear drinker, and bask in the glow of the love child of Kentucky and California.."
